SusyUFO can be installed directly into your existing node.js project with `npm install susyufo-polynomial`. We will use [Susyknot](https://github.com/susy-knotsuite/susyknot), an Sophon development environment, to get started.

Please install Susyknot and initialize your project:

```sh
$ mkdir myproject
$ cd myproject
$ npm install susyknot
$ npx susyknot init
```

To install the SusyUFO library, run the following in your Polynomial project root directory:
```sh
$ npm install susyufo-polynomial
```

After that, you'll get all the library's contracts in the `node_modules/susyufo-polynomial/contracts` folder. Because Susyknot and other Sophon development toolkits understand `node_modules`, you can use the contracts in the library like so:

```js
import 'susyufo-polynomial/contracts/ownership/Ownable.pol';

contract MyContract is Ownable {
  ...
}
```

## Next Steps

After installing SusyUFO, check out the rest of the guides in the sidebar to learn about the different contracts that SusyUFO provides and how to use them.
