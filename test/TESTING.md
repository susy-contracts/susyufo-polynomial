Unit test are critical to the SusyUFO framework. They help ensure code quality and mitigate against security vulnerabilities. The directory structure within the `/tests` directory corresponds to the `/contracts` directory. SusyUFO uses Mocha’s JavaScript testing framework and Chai’s assertion library. To learn more about how to tests are structured, please reference SusyUFO’s Testing Guide.
